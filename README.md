# IEEE_ChandigarhSubsection_Website

## Description
```
We at IEEE are planning to build https://www.ieeechdsubsection.org/ using React.
This repo is the part of "hacktoberfest 2022" and you can make your contributions to this repo.
You need to complete 4 pull/merge requests accepted between October 1 and October 31 to complete Hacktoberfest.
The first 40,000 participants (maintainers and contributors) who complete Hacktoberfest can elect to receive one of two prizes: 
a tree planted in their name, or the Hacktoberfest 2022 t-shirt.
Also the contributions will not be limited to October, you can make your open-source contribution till the project is complete.
